# 🔄 **Python sort() Method**

The `sort()` method sorts the elements of a list in ascending order.

### 👣 **Steps Explained:**

1. **Define the List:**  
   We start with this unsorted list:  
   ```python
   list = [5, 3, 8, 6, 7, 2] 📝
   ```
   We want to sort it in ascending order.

2. **Call the sort() Method:**  
   We use `sort()` to arrange the elements:  
   ```python
   list.sort() 🔢
   ```

3. **Output the Result:**  
   After sorting, we print the list:  
   ```python
   print(list) 🖨️
   ```
   The output will be:  
   ```python
   [2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8] 🎯
   ```
   This means the list is now sorted from smallest to largest.

### 🔍 **What Happens Internally:**

The `sort()` method compares each element in the list and arranges them in ascending order. It modifies the original list directly. ✂️

### 📌 **Important Notes:**

- The `sort()` method works only on **mutable lists** (lists that can be changed).  
- If the list has items that can't be compared (e.g., mixing strings and numbers), it will raise an error. ⚠️  
- By default, `sort()` sorts in **ascending** order. To sort in **descending** order, use:  
   ```python
   list.sort(reverse=True) 🔽
