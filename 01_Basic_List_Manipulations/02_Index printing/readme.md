# 🎯 **Accessing Elements in a List**

You can access specific elements in a list using their index.

### 📋 **Example Code:**

```python
numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
first = numbers[0]  # First element
middle = numbers[2]  # Middle element
last = numbers[-1]  # Last element

print(first)
print(middle)
print(last)
```

✨ **Output:**

```python
10
30
50
```

### 📝 **How the Code Works:**

1. **Define the List:**
   ```python
   numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
   ```
   A list of numbers is created.

2. **Access by Index:**
   - **`numbers[0]`** gets the first element (10).
   - **`numbers[2]`** gets the third element (30).
   - **`numbers[-1]`** gets the last element (50) using negative indexing.

3. **Print Values:**  
   Each element is printed with the `print()` function.

### 🔢 **Understanding Indexing:**

1. **Positive Indexing:**
   - Starts from `0` and increases by 1 for each next element.
   - Example: `numbers[1]` gives the second element.

2. **Negative Indexing:**
   - Starts from `-1` for the last element and decreases by 1 for each previous element.
   - Example: `numbers[-2]` gives the second-to-last element.

### 🚀 **Quick Tips:**

- Use positive indexes to access elements from the start.
- Use negative indexes to access elements from the end of the list.
